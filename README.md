#Helpfullib
This repository will contain simple but useful Java libraries to be used in general applications

#Interactionstructure library 
Helps you create an structured order for method invocation on object instance or class and rules to test in runtime 
if method returns an approved value.
For me a typical scenario where this library would be useful is where we want to put a frame/rules
on operation that should be called in a programmers own code or from API. 
A less abstract idea might be that we would be interest in system critical file 
that needs to be read and where we have structure rules on that file and should abort as soon as error is found.
See invidual files in library to understand more about its feature.

This library works but could possibly be improved so feedback of any sort is of course appreciated.
